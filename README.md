### Overview
This project aims to provide recommendations for Microsoft to enter the movie business. The project uses data on movies and their financial performance to understand the current state of the industry and identify potential opportunities for Microsoft. The project includes data analysis, visualization, and conclusions to assist Microsoft in making informed business decisions.

### Business Understanding
The stakeholders in this project are Microsoft and the movie industry. The key business questions that this project aims to answer include:

-What are the most profitable genres in the movie industry?
-What are the characteristics of successful movies?
-How can Microsoft enter the movie business and be successful?

### Data Understanding and Analysis
The data for this project was obtained from the IMDb website. It includes information on movie titles, release dates, budgets, revenues, and genres.

The data was cleaned and preprocessed to remove missing values and duplicate records. Then, it was analyzed to understand the profitability of different movie genres, the characteristics of successful movies, and potential opportunities for Microsoft in the movie industry.

Visualizations were created to aid in the analysis:

- A few bar charts showing the profit by genre in diffrent ways
- A scatter plot showing the relationship between budget and gross income for movies
- Charts showing the trend of movie profits over runtime and release month

### Conclusion
The analysis of the movie industry data revealed the following findings:

- The most profitable genres in the movie industry are Action, Adventure, and Animation.
- Animation is too volitile so stay away unless you are committed to it.
- Depending on budget, Domestic markets reap greater rewards for lower budgets and foreign markets do better with higher budgets.
- Make the movie range between 95-120 minutes of runtime.
- Release the movie in any of these months: December, June, May, November, or July

There are opportunities for Microsoft to enter the movie industry through partnerships with established studios and investing in the development of original content in the most profitable genres.
Overall, the movie industry is a highly competitive and risky field, but with the right strategy and investments, Microsoft has the potential to be successful.
